# Sort

A collection of (text book) sorting algorithms in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The current list of algorithms include:
* [Gnome sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort)
* [Bubble_sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Insertion_sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
* [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
* [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) and a variant that partitions grouping elements equal to pivot, to avoid worst case of many equal elements.
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) in both top-down and bottom-up versions, but with $O(n)$ auxiliary memory
* The native `stable` and `unstable` sort functions from Rust lib (for comparison)
